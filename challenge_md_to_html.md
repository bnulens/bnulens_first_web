## Exercise

***Note:** it is considered a bad practice to add styling inline in your HTML document.*

### Step 1: Markdown to HTML

1. Start by making an `index.html` file.
1. Add the most basic and important HTML tags (with their required properties) to your document:
    * `html`
    * `head`
    * `body`
    * ...
1. Now convert this markdown document (yes the one you are reading) to HTML. Make sure you use the right HTML tag for each part!


### Step 2: Adding CSS

1. Start by making a `style.css` file.
1. Link the `style.css` file to your `index.html`
1. Write some styling. Make sure that every element has some styling!


### Step 3: Publishing on GitHub pages

1. Google how to publish a page on GitHub. (Or ask [Angel](https://github.com/AngelNedelchev)!)
1. Publish your page on GitHub. (Make sure your file names are correct!)


### Step 4: Audit yourself (bonus)

Use [this tool](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) to audit yourself. It will give you information about a lot of things:
* Best practices
* Performance
* SEO guidelines
* ...


### Step 5: Challenge yourself and eachother (bonus)

Look up some new/more advanced things you can integrate in your first "website". Ask eachother for a challenge, or come and ask me for one, **if you dare**! *Laughs diabolically*
